```

*openrouteservice* R package provides easy access to the
[openrouteservice](https://openrouteservice.org) (ORS) API from R. It allows you
to painlessly consume the following services:

  - `r doc('directions')` (routing)
  - `r doc('geocode')` powered by [Pelias](https://pelias.io)
  - `r doc('isochrones')` (accessibility)
  - time-distance `r doc('matrix')`
  - `r doc('pois')` (points of interest)
  - SRTM `r doc('elevation')` for point and lines geometries
  - routing `r doc('optimization')` based on [Vroom](http://vroom-project.org/)

### Disclaimer

By using this package, you agree to the ORS [terms and
conditions](https://openrouteservice.org/terms-of-service/).

### Installation

The package is not yet available from CRAN, but you can install the
development version directly from GitHub.

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("GIScience/openrouteservice-r")
```
<!-- README END -->

### Setting up API key

In order to start using ORS services you first need to set up your personal API
key, which you can `r openrouteservice:::signup_url("get for free")`.
Once you are signed up, go to https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/home -> `TOKENS`. At the bottom of the page you can request a free token (name can be anything).

```{r api_key, eval=FALSE}
library(openrouteservice)

ors_api_key("<your-api-key>")
```

This will save the key in the default keyring of your system credential store.
Once the key is defined, it persists in the keyring store of the operating
system. This means that it survives beyond the termination of the R session, so
you don't need to set it again each time you start a new R session. To retrieve
the key just call `ors_api_key()` without the `key` argument.

Alternatively, they key can be provided in the environment variable
`ORS_API_KEY`. The value from the environment variable takes precedence over the
former approach allowing to bypass the keyring infrastructure.


## Directions

`ors_directions()` interfaces the ORS directions service to compute routes
between given `coordinates`.

```{r directions, eval=TRUE}
library(openrouteservice)

coordinates <- list(c(8.34234, 48.23424), c(8.34423, 48.26424))

x <- ors_directions(coordinates)
```

Way points can be provided as a list of coordinate pairs `c(lon, lat)`, or a
2-column matrix-like object such as a data frame.

```{r data_frame}
coordinates <- data.frame(lon = c(8.34234, 8.34423), lat = c(48.23424, 48.26424))
```

The response formatting defaults to geoJSON which allows to easily
[visualize](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/json.html#working-with-raw-geojsontopojson)
it with e.g. [leaflet](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=leaflet).

```{r leaflet}
library(leaflet)

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addGeoJSON(x, fill=FALSE) %>%
  fitBBox(x$bbox)
```

Other output formats, such as GPX, can be specified in the argument `format`.
Note that plain JSON response returns the geometry as [Google's encoded
polyline](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm),

```{r encodedpolyline}
x <- ors_directions(coordinates, format = "json")

geometry <- x$routes[[1]]$geometry
str(geometry)
```

so an additional postprocessing step might be necessary.

```{r googlepolyline}
library(googlePolylines)
str(decode(geometry))
```

The API offers a wide range of `profile`s for multiple modes of transport, such
as: car, heavy vehicle, different bicycle types, walking, hiking and wheelchair.
These can be listed with

```{r profiles}
ors_profile()
```

Each of these modes uses a carefully compiled street network to suite the
profiles requirements.

```{r bicycle}
x <- ors_directions(coordinates, profile="cycling-mountain")

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addGeoJSON(x, fill=FALSE) %>%
  fitBBox(x$bbox)
```

Any optional `r openrouteservice:::doc_link('directions', 'query parameters')`
can be specified by providing them as additional `...` arguments to
`ors_directions`. For example, in order to plot the elevation profile of a route
colored by steepness use `elevation = TRUE` to add height to the coordinates of
the points along the route and query for steepness in `extra_info`.

```{r cycling_mountain, message=FALSE}
library("sf")

x <- ors_directions(coordinates, profile = "cycling-mountain", elevation = TRUE,
                    extra_info = "steepness", output = "sf")

height <- st_geometry(x)[[1]][, 3]
```

Here we use [simple features](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf) output for
the sake of easy postprocessing which includes finding the length of individual
route segments and their distance relative to the starting point. These can be
computed with `st_distance()` upon converting the `LINESTRING` to a list of
`POINT`s,

```{r segments}
points <- st_cast(st_geometry(x), "POINT")
n <- length(points)
segments <- cumsum(st_distance(points[-n], points[-1], by_element = TRUE))
```

while their steepness can be extracted from the requested metadata.

```{r steepness}
steepness <- x$extras$steepness$values
steepness <- rep(steepness[,3], steepness[,2]-steepness[,1])
steepness <- factor(steepness, -5:5)

palette = setNames(rev(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(11, "RdYlBu")), levels(steepness))
```

For the final plot we use ggplot2 in combinations with ggforce which supports
handling of length units associated with the data.

```{r elevation_profile, fig.dim=c(10, 5), message=FALSE, out.height='100%'}
library("ggplot2")
library("ggforce")
library("units")

units(height) <- as_units("m")

df <- data.frame(x1 = c(set_units(0, "m"), segments[-(n-1)]),
                 x2 = segments,
                 y1 = height[-n],
                 y2 = height[-1],
                 steepness)

y_ran = range(height) * c(0.9, 1.1)

n = n-1

df2 = data.frame(x = c(df$x1, df$x2, df$x2, df$x1),
                 y = c(rep(y_ran[1], 2*n), df$y2, df$y1),
                 steepness,
                 id = 1:n)

ggplot() + theme_bw() +
  geom_segment(data = df, aes(x1, y1, xend = x2, yend = y2), size = 1) +
  geom_polygon(data = df2, aes(x, y, group = id), fill = "white") +
  geom_polygon(data = df2, aes(x, y , group = id, fill = steepness)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(palette, 0.8), drop = FALSE) +
  scale_x_unit(unit = "km", expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_unit(expand = c(0,0), limits = y_ran) +
  labs(x = "Distance", y = "Height")
```

Advanced `options` are natively formatted as JSON objects, but can be passed as
their R list representation.

```{r bicycle-avoid}
polygon = list(
    type = "Polygon",
    coordinates = list(
      list(
        c(8.330469, 48.261570),
        c(8.339052, 48.261570),
        c(8.339052, 48.258227),
        c(8.330469, 48.258227),
        c(8.330469, 48.261570)
      )
    ),
    properties = ""
  )

options <- list(
  avoid_polygons = polygon
)

x <- ors_directions(coordinates, profile="cycling-mountain", options=options)

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addGeoJSON(polygon, color="#F00") %>%
  addGeoJSON(x, fill=FALSE) %>%
  fitBBox(x$bbox)
```


## Isochrones

Reachability has become a crucial component for many businesses from all
different kinds of domains. `ors_isochrones()` helps you to determine which
areas can be reached from certain location(s) in a given time or travel
distance. The reachability areas are returned as contours of polygons. Next to
the `range` provided in seconds or meters you may as well specify the
corresponding `interval`s. The list of optional arguments to `ors_isochrones()`
is similar as to `ors_directions()`.

```{r isochrones_ranges}
library(mapview)

coordinates <- data.frame(lon = c(8.34234, 8.34234), lat = c(48.23424, 49.23424))

## 1 hour range split into 20 minute intervals
res <- ors_isochrones(coordinates, range = 3600, interval = 1200, output = "sf")
res

values <- levels(factor(res$value))
ranges <- split(res, values)
ranges <- ranges[rev(values)]

names(ranges) <- sprintf("%s min", as.numeric(names(ranges))/60)

mapview(ranges, alpha.regions = 0.2, homebutton = FALSE, legend = FALSE)
```

Here we have used `sf` output for the sake of some further postprocessing and
visualization. By grouping the isochrones according to ranges we gain the
ability of toggling individual ranges when displayed in
[mapview](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mapview). Another option could be
to group by locations. The following example illustrates a possible approach to
applying a custom color palette to the non-overlapping parts of isochrones.

```{r isochrones_colors}
locations = split(res, res$group_index)

locations <- lapply(locations, function(loc) {
  g <- st_geometry(loc)
  g[-which.min(values)] <- st_sfc(Map(st_difference,
                                      g[match(values[-which.min(values)], loc$value)],
                                      g[match(values[-which.max(values)], loc$value)]))
  st_geometry(loc) <- g
  loc
})

isochrones <- unsplit(locations, res$group_index)

pal <- setNames(heat.colors(length(values)), values)
mapview(isochrones, zcol = "value", col = pal, col.regions = pal,
        alpha.regions = 0.5, homebutton = FALSE)
```

## Matrix

One to many, many to many or many to one: `ors_matrix()` allows you to obtain
aggregated time and distance information between a set of locations (origins and
destinations). Unlike `ors_directions()` it does not return detailed route
information. But you may still specify the transportation mode and compute
routes which adhere to certain restrictions, such as avoiding specific road
types or object characteristics.

```{r matrix}
coordinates <- list(
  c(9.970093, 48.477473),
  c(9.207916, 49.153868),
  c(37.573242, 55.801281),
  c(115.663757,38.106467)
)

# query for duration and distance in km
res <- ors_matrix(coordinates, metrics = c("duration", "distance"), units = "km")

# duration in hours
(res$durations / 3600) %>% round(1)

# distance in km
res$distances %>% round
```

## Geocoding

`ors_geocode()` transforms a description of a location provided in `query`, such
as the place's name, street address or postal code, into a normalized
description of the location with a point geometry. Additionally, it offers
reverse geocoding which does exactly the opposite: It returns the next enclosing
object which surrounds the coordinates of the given `location`. To obtain more
relevant results you may also set a radius of tolerance around the requested
coordinates.

```{r geocode}
## locations of Heidelberg around the globe
x <- ors_geocode("Heidelberg")

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addGeoJSON(x) %>%
  fitBBox(x$bbox)

## set the number of results returned
x <- ors_geocode("Heidelberg", size = 1)

## search within a particular country
x <- ors_geocode("Heidelberg", boundary.country = "DE")

## structured geocoding
x <- ors_geocode(list(locality="Heidelberg", county="Heidelberg"))

## reverse geocoding
location <- x$features[[1L]]$geometry$coordinates

y <- ors_geocode(location = location, layers = "locality", size = 1)
```


## POIs

This service allows you to find places of interest around or within given
geographic coordinates. You may search for given features around a point, path
or even within a polygon specified in `geometry`. To list all the available POI
categories use `ors_pois('list')`.

```{r pois}
geometry <- list(
  geojson = list(
    type = "Point",
    coordinates = c(8.8034, 53.0756)
  ),
  buffer = 500
)

ors_pois(
  request = 'pois',
  geometry = geometry,
  limit = 2000,
  sortby = "distance",
  filters = list(
    category_ids = 488,
    wheelchair = "yes"
  ),
  output = "sf"
)
```

You can gather statistics on the amount of certain POIs in an area by using
`request='stats'`.

```{r stats}
ors_pois(
  request = 'stats',
  geometry = geometry,
  limit = 2000,
  sortby = "distance",
  filters = list(category_ids = 488)
  )
```


## Elevation

Given a point or line geometry you can use `ors_elevation` to query for its
elevation.

```{r elevation}
x <- ors_geocode("KÃ¶nigstuhl", output = "sf")

ors_elevation("point", st_coordinates(x))
```


## Optimization 

The optimization endpoint solves the [vehicle routing
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem) (VRP) of finding
an optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver
to a given set of locations. The service is based on
[Vroom](https://github.com/VROOM-Project/vroom) and can be used to schedule
multiple vehicles and jobs respecting time windows, capacities and required
skills. VRP generalizes the classic [traveling salesman
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) of finding
the fastest or shortest possible route that visits a given list of locations.  

The following example involves a 2-vehicle fleet carrying out deliveries across
6 locations.

```{r vehicles}
home_base <- data.frame(lon = 2.35044, lat = 48.71764)

vehicles = vehicles(
  id = 1:2,
  profile = "driving-car",
  start = home_base,
  end = home_base,
  capacity = 4,
  skills = list(c(1, 14), c(2, 14)),
  time_window = c(28800, 43200)
)
```
 
Both `vehicles` share the `start`/`end` points and have the same `capacity`, but
differ in the set of `skills` assigned. We are interested in using them to serve
a number of `jobs` with certain `skills` requirements between `locations`. These
skills are mandatory, which means a given job can only be served by a vehicle
that has all its required skills.

```{r jobs}
locations <- list(
  c(1.98935, 48.701),
  c(2.03655, 48.61128),
  c(2.39719, 49.07611),
  c(2.41808, 49.22619),
  c(2.28325, 48.5958),
  c(2.89357, 48.90736)
)

jobs = jobs(
  id = 1:6,
  service = 300,
  amount = 1,
  location = locations,
  skills = list(1, 1, 2, 2, 14, 14)
)
```

The helper functions `vehicles` and `jobs` produce `data.frame`s which have the
format appropriate for `ors_optimization`. Route geometries are enabled by
setting the corresponding flag in `options`.

```{r optimization}
res <- ors_optimization(jobs, vehicles, options = list(g = TRUE))
```

The geometries are returned as [Google's encoded
polylines](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm),
so for visualization in leaflet they need to be decoded. Furthermore, we extract
the job locations from the response such that we can label them in the order in
which they are visited along the routes.

```{r}
lapply(res$routes, with, {
  list(
    geometry = googlePolylines::decode(geometry)[[1L]],
    locations = lapply(steps, with, if (type=="job") location) %>%
      do.call(rbind, .) %>% data.frame %>% setNames(c("lon", "lat"))
  )
  }) -> routes

## Helper function to add a list of routes and their ordered waypoints
addRoutes <- function(map, routes, colors) {
  routes <- mapply(c, routes, color = colors, SIMPLIFY = FALSE)
  f <- function (map, route) {
    with(route, {
      labels <- sprintf("<b>%s</b>", 1:nrow(locations))
      markers <- awesomeIcons(markerColor = color, text = labels, fontFamily = "arial")
      map %>%
        addPolylines(data = geometry, lng = ~lon, lat = ~lat, col = ~color) %>%
        addAwesomeMarkers(data = locations, lng = ~lon, lat = ~lat, icon = markers)
    })
  }
  Reduce(f, routes, map)
}

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addAwesomeMarkers(data = home_base, icon = awesomeIcons("home")) %>%
  addRoutes(routes, c("purple", "green"))
```
